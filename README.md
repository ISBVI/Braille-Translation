# We are Purdue EPICS ISBVI!

EPICS is a unique program in which teams of undergraduates are designing, building, and deploying real systems to solve engineering-based problems for local community service and education organizations. This program was founded at Purdue University in 1995.

We are the ISBVI (Indiana School of the Blind and Visually Impaired) team within this program and are creating technologies and services to help blind and visually impaired people.
